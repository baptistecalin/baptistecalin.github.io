    "summary": "With over 15 years of experience in software engineering and quality management, I bring a unique dual expertise that bridges the gap between technical innovation and regulatory compliance.<br/><br/>I started my career as a software developer and architect, building scalable applications with Java, Spring, Node.js and React. Over time, I expanded into DevSecOps, CI/CD automation, and test engineering, ensuring that solutions are not only innovative but also robust and secure.<br/><br/>In parallel, I specialized as a Quality Expert in the healthcare and medical device sector, where I led the implementation and optimization of Quality Management Systems (QMS), achieved ISO 13485 and MDR compliance, and supported organizations in navigating complex regulatory frameworks.<br/><br/>What sets me apart is my ability to combine deep technical knowledge with a strong process and compliance mindset. Whether it’s building applications in a regulated environment, structuring and digitalizing quality processes, or driving cultural change in organizations, I provide both the strategic vision and the hands-on technical execution.<br/><br/>Core strengths:<br/>- Software Development & Architecture (Java, Spring, Node.js, React, SQL, CI/CD, DevSecOps)<br/>- Quality & Compliance (ISO 13485, MDR, ISO 14971, ISO 12207, ISO 9001, ITIL, GDPR)<br/>- Leadership & Change (team coaching, KPI-driven improvement, agile delivery)<br/>- Tools & Automation (GitLab, Jenkins, SonarQube, Jira, Confluence, Docker, PowerBI)<br/><br/>My mission: to help companies deliver secure, high-quality, compliant digital solutions and implement and optimise quality systems that accelerate innovation while meeting the most stringent regulatory standards.",
