✅ Software Engineer (Fuul-Stack) & Quality Expert | Secure, Compliant & Innovative Digital Solutions | 🌐 baptistecalin.github.io

---

With over 15 years of experience in software engineering and quality management, I bring a unique dual expertise that bridges the gap between technical innovation and regulatory compliance.

I started my career as a software developer and architect, building scalable applications with Java, Node.js, React, and Spring Boot. Over time, I expanded into DevSecOps, CI/CD automation, and test engineering, ensuring that solutions are not only innovative but also robust and secure.

In parallel, I specialized as a Quality Expert in the healthcare and medical device sector, where I led the implementation and optimization of Quality Management Systems (QMS), achieved ISO 13485 and MDR compliance, and supported organizations in navigating complex regulatory frameworks.

What sets me apart is my ability to combine deep technical knowledge with a strong process and compliance mindset. Whether it’s building applications in a regulated environment, structuring and digitalizing quality processes, or driving cultural change in organizations, I provide both the strategic vision and the hands-on technical execution.

🔹 Core strengths:

✅ Software Development & Architecture (Java, Node.js, React, SQL, CI/CD, DevSecOps)
✅ Quality & Compliance (ISO 13485, MDR, ISO 14971, ISO 12207, ISO 9001, ITIL, GDPR)
✅ Leadership & Change (team coaching, KPI-driven improvement, agile delivery)
✅ Tools & Automation (GitLab, Jenkins, SonarQube, Jira, Confluence, Docker, PowerBI)

👉 My mission: to help companies deliver secure, high-quality, compliant digital solutions and implement and optimise quality systems that accelerate innovation while meeting the most stringent regulatory standards.
